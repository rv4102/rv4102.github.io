      <description>Hi everyone! This is a personal blog about my journey towards securing an internship at Sprinklr for the summer of 2024 through IIT Kharagpur&amp;rsquo;s CDC Internship process.
. . .
The Beginning Owing to Covid, our batch had to wait 2 months for college to begin and even when it did during December 2020, it was online! What a bummer for a starry-eyed fresher. Among the hubbub regarding various societies and their selections, I came across Business Club and was competent enough to clear their selection process.</description>

      <description>My Projects (Group and Personal): Distributed Database Development | Distributed Systems Objective: Create a replicated database with sharding and incorporate Write-Ahead Logging mechanism Created a dockerized database container with consistent hashing for load-balancing, ensuring balanced distribution of write requests among shard replicas. Ensured scalability by supporting faster reads with dynamic increment of replicas and larger database size with additional shards and servers. Developed a Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism for data consistency and recovery by first recording changes before committing them to disk.</description>
