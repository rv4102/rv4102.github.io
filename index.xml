      <description>Hi everyone! This is a personal blog about my journey towards securing an internship at Sprinklr for the summer of 2024 through IIT Kharagpur&amp;rsquo;s CDC Internship process.
. . .
The Beginning Owing to Covid, our batch had to wait 2 months for college to begin and even when it did during December 2020, it was online! What a bummer for a starry-eyed fresher. Among the hubbub regarding various societies and their selections, I came across Business Club and was competent enough to clear their selection process.</description>

      <description>List of Projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve Done over time: Lunar Turing-GAN Super-Resolution Model Objective: Create a high-resolution map of the Moon using a pipeline of Image Super-Resolution models Proposed a novel GAN-based architecture with turing test based adversaries for ensuring accurate reconstruction of craters and hills. Achieved a competitive SSIM of 0.794 while increasing image spatial resolution from 5m per pixel to 30 cm per pixel, a 16x magnification. Created a pipeline capable of tiling and super-resolving an image using Lunar T-GAN, HAT, RealESRGAN and sharpening algorithms.</description>
